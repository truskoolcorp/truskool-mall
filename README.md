# Truskool Mall — Three.js + WebXR starter\n\nThis is a minimal starting point to build a virtual shopping mall using Three.js + WebXR.\n\nFeatures included:\n- Three.js scene with WebXR enabled\n- VRButton to enter/exit VR\n- Controller visuals and a simple point-and-teleport mechanic\n- GLTF loader for adding shop models (place assets in /public/assets)\n\nHow to run\n1. Install:\n   npm install\n\n2. Start dev server (Vite):\n   npm run dev\n\n3. Open in a compatible browser:\n   - Use `https://localhost` or `http://localhost` (WebXR works on secure contexts except on localhost)\n   - Recommended: Chrome with WebXR / Oculus Browser on Quest / Edge with WebXR support\n\nWhere to put assets\n- Place GLTF/GLB files in /public/assets (Vite serves the public folder as root)\n- The starter code tries to load `/assets/mall_centerpiece.glb` — replace with your own asset or remove that call\n\nRecommended next steps\n- Replace placeholder shops with optimized GLTF shop models\n- Build a navigation mesh for free movement or more robust teleporting (navmesh + pathfinding)\n- Add product interaction UI (gaze / controller ray) using three-mesh-ui or HTML panels in world-space\n- Implement LOD, texture atlases and mesh instancing for performance\n- Add server-side API for dynamic shop/product content\n- Consider accessibility: seated mode, locomotion options, comfort mode, subtitles\n\nNotes\n- WebXR requires HTTPS in production; localhost is allowed for development.\n- Test on target devices early (Quest/Meta Browser, Pico, or PC + headset) — behavior differs per device.
